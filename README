Ensuring code is functional and secure can be done by appropriately parameterizing code, implementation of JUnit test cases, certification writing, and refactoring code
as deemed necessary by dependency check reports (verifying vulnerabilities and accounting for them with an appropriate cipher.)  User Needs
can be found appropriately through doing UML diagrams and appropriately planning with pseudocode/flowcharts.  Software design can then be designed
while taking into account user needs and possibilities through use cases.
